//UNSHIFT METHOD

/*The .unshift() method of an array allows you to add a value to the beginning of the array, unlike .push() which adds the value at the end of the array. .unshift() returns the new length of the array it was called on.*/

let fruits = ["Apples", "Oranges", "Cherries"];
console.log(fruits);

//Unshift Method -- add a fruit to the beginning of the list


fruits.unshift("Pineapples");

console.log(fruits);
